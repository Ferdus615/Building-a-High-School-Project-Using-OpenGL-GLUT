# Building-a-High-School-Project-Using-OpenGL-GLUT
I have created a High School Building &amp; its surrounding environment using OpenGL &amp; GLUT. The purpose of this porject was to show a 3D rendered view of a High School Building & its surrounding environmnts. You can move freely through the whole scene using specified keys.

2. OpenGL library
3. GLUT library

# About the Project

2. There are boundarie of the school area.
3. A footpath for the students to safely walk.
4. A road for transportation in front of the school.
5. Surrounding Environments.

2. Compile the whole project on any compatible C++ compiler.
3. Now run the program or you can run the executable.
